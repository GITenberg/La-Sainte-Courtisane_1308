vii</span>PREFACE</h2>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;<i>As to my personal attitude towards
criticism</i>, <i>I confess in brief the
following</i>:&mdash;&ldquo;<i>If my works are good and of any
importance whatever for the further development of art</i>,
<i>they will maintain their place in spite of all adverse
criticism and in spite of all hateful suspicions attached to my
artistic intentions</i>.&nbsp; <i>If my works are of no
account</i>, <i>the most gratifying success of the moment and the
most enthusiastic approval of as augurs cannot make them
endure</i>.&nbsp; <i>The waste-paper press can devour them as it
has devoured many others</i>, <i>and I will not shed a tear . . .
and the world will move on just the
same</i>.&rdquo;&rsquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Richard
Strauss</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> contents of this volume require
some explanation of an historical nature.&nbsp; It is scarcely
realised by the present generation that Wilde&rsquo;s works on
their first appearance, with the exception of <i>De
Profundis</i>, were met with almost general condemnation and
ridicule.&nbsp; The plays on their first production were
grudgingly praised because their obvious success could not be
ignored; but on their subsequent publication in book form they
were violently assailed.&nbsp; That nearly all of them have held
the stage is still a source of irritation among certain
journalists.&nbsp; <i>Salom&eacute;</i> however enjoys a singular
career.&nbsp; As every one knows, it was prohibited by the Censor
when in rehearsal by Madame Bernhardt at the Palace Theatre in
1892.&nbsp; On its publication in 1893 it was greeted with
greater abuse than any other of Wilde&rsquo;s works, and was
consigned to the usual irrevocable oblivion.&nbsp; The accuracy
of the French was freely canvassed, and of course it is obvious
that the French is not that of a Frenchman.&nbsp; The play was
passed for press, however, by no less a writer than Marcel Schwob
whose letter to the Paris publisher, returning the proofs and
mentioning two or three slight alterations, is still in my
possession.&nbsp; Marcel Schwob told me some years afterwards
that he thought it would have spoiled the spontaneity and
character of Wilde&rsquo;s style if he had tried to harmonise it
with the diction demanded by the French Academy.&nbsp; It was
never composed with any idea of presentation.&nbsp; Madame
Bernhardt happened to say she wished Wilde would write a play for
her; he replied in jest that he had done so.&nbsp; She insisted
on seeing the manuscript, and decided on its immediate
production, ignorant or forgetful of the English law which
prohibits the introduction of Scriptural characters on the
stage.&nbsp; With his keen sense of the theatre Wilde would never
have contrived the long speech of Salom&eacute; at the end in a
drama intended for the stage, even in the days of long
speeches.&nbsp; His threat to change his nationality shortly
after the Censor&rsquo;s interference called forth a most
delightful and good-natured caricature of him by Mr. Bernard
Partridge in <i>Punch</i>.</p>
<p>Wilde was still in prison in 1896 when <i>Salom&eacute;</i>
was produced by Lugne Po&euml; at the Th&eacute;&agrave;tre de
L&rsquo;&OElig;uvre in Paris, but except for an account in the
<i>Daily Telegraph</i> the incident was hardly mentioned in
England.&nbsp; I gather that the performance was only a qualified
success, though Lugne Po&euml;&rsquo;s triumph as Herod was
generally acknowledged.&nbsp; In 1901, within a year of the
author&rsquo;s death, it was produced in Berlin; from that moment
it has held the European stage.&nbsp; It has run for a longer
consecutive period in Germany than any play by any Englishman,
not excepting Shakespeare.&nbsp; Its popularity has extended to
all countries where it is not prohibited.&nbsp; It is performed
throughout Europe, Asia and America.&nbsp; It is played even in
Yiddish.&nbsp; This is remarkable in view of the many dramas by
French and German writers who treat of the same theme.&nbsp; To
none of them, however, is Wilde indebted.&nbsp; Flaubert,
Maeterlinck (some would add Ollendorff) and Scripture, are the
obvious sources on which he has freely drawn for what I do not
hesitate to call the most powerful and perfect of all his
dramas.&nbsp; But on such a point a trustee and executor may be
prejudiced because it is the most valuable asset in Wilde&rsquo;s
literary estate.&nbsp; Aubrey Beardsley&rsquo;s illustrations are
too well known to need more than a passing reference.&nbsp; In
the world of art criticism they excited almost as much attention
as Wilde&rsquo;s drama has excited in the world of intellect.</p>
<p>During May 1905 the play was produced in England for the first
time at a private performance by the New Stage Club.&nbsp; No one
present will have forgotten the extraordinary tension of the
audience on that occasion, those who disliked the play and its
author being hypnotised by the extraordinary power of Mr. Robert
Farquharson&rsquo;s Herod, one of the finest pieces of acting
ever seen in this country.&nbsp; My friends the dramatic critics
(and many of them are personal friends) fell on
<i>Salom&eacute;</i> with all the vigour of their predecessors
twelve years before.&nbsp; Unaware of what was taking place in
Germany, they spoke of the play as having been &lsquo;dragged
from obscurity.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Official Receiver in Bankruptcy
and myself were, however, better informed.&nbsp; And much
pleasure has been derived from reading those criticisms, all
carefully preserved along with the list of receipts which were
simultaneously pouring in from the German performances.&nbsp; To
do the critics justice they never withdrew any of their printed
opinions, which were all trotted out again when the play was
produced privately for the second time in England by the Literary
Theatre Society in 1906.&nbsp; In the <i>Speaker</i> of July
14th, 1906, however, some of the iterated misrepresentations of
fact were corrected.&nbsp; No attempt was made to controvert the
opinion of an ignorant critic: his veracity only was
impugned.&nbsp; The powers of vaticination possessed by such
judges of drama can be fairly tested in the career of
<i>Salom&eacute;</i> on the European stage, apart from the
opera.&nbsp; In an introduction to the English translation
published by Mr. John Lane it is pointed out that Wilde&rsquo;s
confusion of Herod Antipas (Matt. xiv. 1) with Herod the Great
(Matt. ii. 1) and Herod Agrippa <span class="GutSmall">I.</span>
(Acts xii. 23) is intentional, and follows a medi&aelig;val
convention.&nbsp; There is no attempt at historical accuracy or
arch&aelig;ological exactness.&nbsp; Those who saw the marvellous
<i>d&eacute;cor</i> of Mr. Charles Ricketts at the second English
production can form a complete idea of what Wilde intended in
that respect; although the stage management was clumsy and
amateurish.&nbsp; The great opera of Richard Strauss does not
fall within my province; but the fag ends of its popularity on
the Continent have been imported here oddly enough through the
agency of the Palace Theatre, where <i>Salom&eacute;</i> was
originally to have been performed.&nbsp; Of a young lady&rsquo;s
dancing, or of that of her rivals, I am not qualified to
speak.&nbsp; I note merely that the critics who objected to the
horror of one incident in the drama lost all self-control on
seeing that incident repeated in dumb show and accompanied by
fescennine corybantics.&nbsp; Except in &lsquo;name and borrowed
notoriety&rsquo; the music-hall sensation has no relation
whatever to the drama which so profoundly moved the whole of
Europe and the greatest living musician.&nbsp; The adjectives of
contumely are easily transmuted into epithets of adulation, when
a prominent ecclesiastic succumbs, like King Herod, to the
fascination of a dancer.</p>
<p>It is not usually known in England that a young French naval
officer, unaware that Dr. Strauss was composing an opera on the
theme of <i>Salom&eacute;</i>, wrote another music drama to
accompany Wilde&rsquo;s text.&nbsp; The exclusive musical rights
having been already secured by Dr. Strauss, Lieutenant
Marriotte&rsquo;s work cannot be performed regularly.&nbsp; One
presentation, however, was permitted at Lyons, the
composer&rsquo;s native town, where I am told it made an
extraordinary impression.&nbsp; In order to give English readers
some faint idea of the world-wide effect of Wilde&rsquo;s drama,
my friend Mr. Walter Ledger has prepared a short bibliography of
certain English and Continental translations.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>At the time of Wilde&rsquo;s trial the nearly completed MS. of
<i>La Sainte Courtisane</i> was entrusted to Mrs. Leverson, the
well-known novelist, who in 1897 went to Paris on purpose to
restore it to the author.&nbsp; Wilde immediately left the only
copy in a cab.&nbsp; A few days later he laughingly informed me
of the loss, and added that a cab was a very proper place for
it.&nbsp; I have explained elsewhere that he looked on his works
with disdain in his last years, though he was always full of
schemes for writing others.&nbsp; All my attempts to recover the
lost work failed.&nbsp; The passages here reprinted are from some
odd leaves of a first draft.&nbsp; The play is, of course, not
unlike <i>Salom&eacute;</i>, though it was written in
English.&nbsp; It expanded Wilde&rsquo;s favourite theory that
when you convert some one to an idea, you lose your faith in it;
the same motive runs through <i>Mr. W. H.</i>&nbsp; Honorius the
hermit, so far as I recollect the story, falls in love with the
courtesan who has come to tempt him, and he reveals to her the
secret of the love of God.&nbsp; She immediately becomes a
Christian, and is murdered by robbers.&nbsp; Honorius the hermit
goes back to Alexandria to pursue a life of pleasure.&nbsp; Two
other similar plays Wilde invented in prison, <i>Ahab and
Isabel</i> and <i>Pharaoh</i>; he would never write them down,
though often importuned to do so.&nbsp; <i>Pharaoh</i> was
intensely dramatic and perhaps more original than any of the
group.&nbsp; None of these works must be confused with the
manuscripts stolen from 16 Tite Street in 1895&mdash;namely, the
enlarged version of <i>Mr. W. H.</i>, the second draft of <i>A
Florentine Tragedy</i>, and <i>The Duchess of Padua</i> (which,
existing in a prompt copy, was of less importance than the
others); nor with <i>The Cardinal of Arragon</i>, the manuscript
of which I never saw.&nbsp; I scarcely think it ever existed,
though Wilde used to recite proposed passages for it.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Some years after Wilde&rsquo;s death I was looking over the
papers and letters rescued from Tite Street when I came across
loose sheets of manuscript and typewriting, which I imagined were
fragments of <i>The Duchess of Padua</i>; on putting them
together in a coherent form I recognised that they belonged to
the lost <i>Florentine Tragedy</i>.&nbsp; I assumed that the
opening scene, though once extant, had disappeared.&nbsp; One
day, however, Mr. Willard wrote that he possessed a typewritten
fragment of a play which Wilde had submitted to him, and this he
kindly forwarded for my inspection.&nbsp; It agreed in nearly
every particular with what I had taken so much trouble to put
together.&nbsp; This suggests that the opening scene had never
been written, as Mr. Willard&rsquo;s version began where mine
did.&nbsp; It was characteristic of the author to finish what he
never began.</p>
<p>When the Literary Theatre Society produced
<i>Salom&eacute;</i> in 1906 they asked me for some other short
drama by Wilde to present at the same time, as
<i>Salom&eacute;</i> does not take very long to play.&nbsp; I
offered them the fragment of <i>A Florentine Tragedy</i>.&nbsp;
By a fortunate coincidence the poet and dramatist, Mr. Thomas
Sturge Moore, happened to be on the committee of this Society,
and to him was entrusted the task of writing an opening scene to
make the play complete.&nbsp; It is not for me to criticise his
work, but there is justification for saying that Wilde himself
would have envied, with an artist&rsquo;s envy, such lines
as&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>We will sup with the moon,<br />
Like Persian princes that in Babylon<br />
Sup in the hanging gardens of the King.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a stylistic sense Mr. Sturge Moore has accomplished a feat
in reconstruction, whatever opinions may be held of <i>A
Florentine Tragedy</i> by Wilde&rsquo;s admirers or
detractors.&nbsp; The achievement is particularly remarkable
because Mr. Sturge Moore has nothing in common with Wilde other
than what is shared by all real poets and dramatists: He is a
landed proprietor on Parnassus, not a trespasser.&nbsp; In
England we are more familiar with the poachers.&nbsp; Time and
Death are of course necessary before there can come any adequate
recognition of one of our most original and gifted singers.&nbsp;
Among his works are <i>The Vinedresser and other Poems</i>
(1899), <i>Absalom</i>, <i>A Chronicle Play</i> (1903), and
<i>The Centaur&rsquo;s Booty</i> (1903).&nbsp; Mr. Sturge Moore
is also an art critic of distinction, and his learned works on
D&uuml;rer (1905) and Correggio (1906) are more widely known (I
am sorry to say) than his powerful and enthralling poems.</p>
<p>Once again I must express my obligations to Mr. Stuart Mason
for revising and correcting the proofs of this new edition.</p>

<h3>LA SAINTE COURTISANE<br />
<span class="GutSmall">OR, THE WOMAN COVERED WITH
JEWELS</span></h3>
<p><i>The scene represents the corner of a valley in the
Thebaid</i>.&nbsp; <i>On the right hand of the stage is a
cavern.&nbsp; In front of the cavern stands a great
crucifix</i>.</p>
<p><i>On the left</i> [<i>sand dunes</i>].</p>
<p><i>The sky is blue like the inside of a cup of lapis
lazuli</i>.&nbsp; <i>The hills are of red sand</i>.&nbsp; <i>Here
and there on the hills there are clumps of thorns</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">First Man</span>.&nbsp; Who is she?&nbsp;
She makes me afraid.&nbsp; She has a purple cloak and her hair is
like threads of gold.&nbsp; I think she must be the daughter of
the Emperor.&nbsp; I have heard the boatmen say that the Emperor
has a daughter who wears a cloak of purple.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Second Man</span>.&nbsp; She has
birds&rsquo; wings upon her sandals, and her tunic is of the
colour of green corn.&nbsp; It is like corn in spring when she
stands still.&nbsp; It is like young corn troubled by the shadows
of hawks when she moves.&nbsp; The pearls on her tunic are like
many moons.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">First Man</span>.&nbsp; They are like the
moons one sees in the water when the wind blows from the
hills.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Second Man</span>.&nbsp; I think she is
one of the gods.&nbsp; I think she comes from Nubia.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">First Man</span>.&nbsp; I am sure she is
the daughter of the Emperor.&nbsp; Her nails are stained with
henna.&nbsp; They are like the petals of a rose.&nbsp; She has
come here to weep for Adonis.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Second Man</span>.&nbsp; She is one of the
gods.&nbsp; I do not know why she has left her temple.&nbsp; The
gods should not leave their temples.&nbsp; If she speaks to us
let us not answer, and she will pass by.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">First Man</span>.&nbsp; She will not speak
to us.&nbsp; She is the daughter of the Emperor.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Myrrhina</span>.&nbsp; Dwells he not here,
the beautiful young hermit, he who will not look on the face of
woman?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">First Man</span>.&nbsp; Of a truth it is
here the hermit dwells.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Myrrhina</span>.&nbsp; Why will he not
look on the face of woman?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Second Man</span>.&nbsp; We do not
know.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Myrrhina</span>.&nbsp; Why do ye
yourselves not look at me?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">First Man</span>.&nbsp; You are covered
with bright stones, and you dazzle our eyes.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Second Man</span>.&nbsp; He who looks at
the sun becomes blind.&nbsp; You are too bright to look at.&nbsp;
It is not wise to look at things that are very bright.&nbsp; Many
of the priests in the temples are blind, and have slaves to lead
them.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Myrrhina</span>.&nbsp; Where does he
dwell, the beautiful young hermit who will not look on the face
of woman?&nbsp; Has he a house of reeds or a house of burnt clay
or does he lie on the hillside?&nbsp; Or does he make his bed in
the rushes?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">First Man</span>.&nbsp; He dwells in that
cavern yonder.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Myrrhina</span>.&nbsp; What a curious
place to dwell in!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">First Man</span>.&nbsp; Of old a centaur
lived there.&nbsp; When the hermit came the centaur gave a shrill
cry, wept and lamented, and galloped away.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Second Man</span>.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; It was
a white unicorn who lived in the cave.&nbsp; When it saw the
hermit coming the unicorn knelt down and worshipped him.&nbsp;
Many people saw it worshipping him.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">First Man</span>.&nbsp; I have talked with
people who saw it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">. . . . .</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Second Man</span>.&nbsp; Some say he was a
hewer of wood and worked for hire.&nbsp; But that may not be
true.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">. . . . .</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Myrrhina</span>.&nbsp; What gods then do
ye worship?&nbsp; Or do ye worship any gods?&nbsp; There are
those who have no gods to worship.&nbsp; The philosophers who
wear long beards and brown cloaks have no gods to worship.&nbsp;
They wrangle with each other in the porticoes.&nbsp; The [ ]
laugh at them.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">First Man</span>.&nbsp; We worship seven
gods.&nbsp; We may not tell their names.&nbsp; It is a very
dangerous thing to tell the names of the gods.&nbsp; No one
should ever tell the name of his god.&nbsp; Even the priests who
praise the gods all day long, and eat of their food with them, do
not call them by their right names.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Myrrhina</span>.&nbsp; Where are these
gods ye worship?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">First Man</span>.&nbsp; We hide them in
the folds of our tunics.&nbsp; We do not show them to any
one.&nbsp; If we showed them to any one they might leave us.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Myrrhina</span>.&nbsp; Where did ye meet
with them?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">First Man</span>.&nbsp; They were given to
us by an embalmer of the dead who had found them in a tomb.&nbsp;
We served him for seven years.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Myrrhina</span>.&nbsp; The dead are
terrible.&nbsp; I am afraid of Death.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">First Man</span>.&nbsp; Death is not a
god.&nbsp; He is only the servant of the gods.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Myrrhina</span>.&nbsp; He is the only god
I am afraid of.&nbsp; Ye have seen many of the gods?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">First Man</span>.&nbsp; We have seen many
of them.&nbsp; One sees them chiefly at night time.&nbsp; They
pass one by very swiftly.&nbsp; Once we saw some of the gods at
daybreak.&nbsp; They were walking across a plain.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Myrrhina</span>.&nbsp; Once as I was
passing through the market place I heard a sophist from Cilicia
say that there is only one God.&nbsp; He said it before many
people.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">First Man</span>.&nbsp; That cannot be
true.&nbsp; We have ourselves seen many, though we are but common
men and of no account.&nbsp; When I saw them I hid myself in a
bush.&nbsp; They did me no harm.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">. . . . .</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Myrrhina</span>.&nbsp; Tell me more about
the beautiful young hermit.&nbsp; Talk to me about the beautiful
young hermit who will not look on the face of woman.&nbsp; What
is the story of his days?&nbsp; What mode of life has he?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">First Man</span>.&nbsp; We do not
understand you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Myrrhina</span>.&nbsp; What does he do,
the beautiful young hermit?&nbsp; Does he sow or reap?&nbsp; Does
he plant a garden or catch fish in a net?&nbsp; Does he weave
linen on a loom?&nbsp; Does he set his hand to the wooden plough
and walk behind the oxen?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Second Man</span>.&nbsp; He being a very
holy man does nothing.&nbsp; We are common men and of no
account.&nbsp; We toll all day long in the sun.&nbsp; Sometimes
the ground is very hard.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Myrrhina</span>.&nbsp; Do the birds of the
air feed him?&nbsp; Do the jackals share their booty with
him?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">First Man</span>.&nbsp; Every evening we
bring him food.&nbsp; We do not think that the birds of the air
feed him.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Myrrhina</span>.&nbsp; Why do ye feed
him?&nbsp; What profit have ye in so doing?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Second Man</span>.&nbsp; He is a very holy
man.&nbsp; One of the gods whom he has offended has made him
mad.&nbsp; We think he has offended the moon.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Myrrhina</span>.&nbsp; Go and tell him
that one who has come from Alexandria desires to speak with
him.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">First Man</span>.&nbsp; We dare not tell
him.&nbsp; This hour he is praying to his God.&nbsp; We pray thee
to pardon us for not doing thy bidding.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Myrrhina</span>.&nbsp; Are ye afraid, of
him?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">First Man</span>.&nbsp; We are afraid of
him.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Myrrhina</span>.&nbsp; Why are ye afraid
of him?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">First Man</span>.&nbsp; We do not
know.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Myrrhina</span>.&nbsp; What is his
name?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">First Man</span>.&nbsp; The voice that
speaks to him at night time in the cavern calls to him by the
name of Honorius.&nbsp; It was also by the name of Honorius that
the three lepers who passed by once called to him.&nbsp; We think
that his name is Honorius.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Myrrhina</span>.&nbsp; Why did the three
lepers call to him?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">First Man</span>.&nbsp; That he might heal
them.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Myrrhina</span>.&nbsp; Did he heal
them?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Second Man</span>.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; They
had committed some sin: it was for that reason they were
lepers.&nbsp; Their hands and faces were like salt.&nbsp; One of
them wore a mask of linen.&nbsp; He was a king&rsquo;s son.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Myrrhina</span>.&nbsp; What is the voice
that speaks to him at night time in his cave?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">First Man</span>.&nbsp; We do not know
whose voice it is.&nbsp; We think it is the voice of his
God.&nbsp; For we have seen no man enter his cavern nor any come
forth from it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">. . . . .</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Myrrhina</span>.&nbsp; Honorius.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Honorius</span> (<i>from
within</i>).&nbsp; Who calls Honorius?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Myrrhina</span>.&nbsp; Come forth,
Honorius.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">. . . . .</p>
<p>My chamber is ceiled with cedar and odorous with myrrh.&nbsp;
The pillars of my bed are of cedar and the hangings are of
purple.&nbsp; My bed is strewn with purple and the steps are of
silver.&nbsp; The hangings are sewn with silver pomegranates and
the steps that are of silver are strewn with saffron and with
myrrh.&nbsp; My lovers hang garlands round the pillars of my
house.&nbsp; At night time they come with the flute players and
the players of the harp.&nbsp; They woo me with apples and on the
pavement of my courtyard they write my name in wine.</p>
<p>From the uttermost parts of the world my lovers come to
me.&nbsp; The kings of the earth come to me and bring me
presents.</p>
<p>When the Emperor of Byzantium heard of me he left his porphyry
chamber and set sail in his galleys.&nbsp; His slaves bare no
torches that none might know of his coming.&nbsp; When the King
of Cyprus heard of me he sent me ambassadors.&nbsp; The two Kings
of Libya who are brothers brought me gifts of amber.</p>
<p>I took the minion of C&aelig;sar from C&aelig;sar and made him
my playfellow.&nbsp; He came to me at night in a litter.&nbsp; He
was pale as a narcissus, and his body was like honey.</p>
<p>The son of the Pr&aelig;fect slew himself in my honour, and
the Tetrarch of Cilicia scourged himself for my pleasure before
my slaves.</p>
<p>The King of Hierapolis who is a priest and a robber set
carpets for me to walk on.</p>
<p>Sometimes I sit in the circus and the gladiators fight beneath
me.&nbsp; Once a Thracian who was my lover was caught in the
net.&nbsp; I gave the signal for him to die and the whole theatre
applauded.&nbsp; Sometimes I pass through the gymnasium and watch
the young men wrestling or in the race.&nbsp; Their bodies are
bright with oil and their brows are wreathed with willow sprays
and with myrtle.&nbsp; They stamp their feet on the sand when
they wrestle and when they run the sand follows them like a
little cloud.&nbsp; He at whom I smile leaves his companions and
follows me to my home.&nbsp; At other times I go down to the
harbour and watch the merchants unloading their vessels.&nbsp;
Those that come from Tyre have cloaks of silk and earrings of
emerald.&nbsp; Those that come from Massilia have cloaks of fine
wool and earrings of brass.&nbsp; When they see me coming they
stand on the prows of their ships and call to me, but I do not
answer them.&nbsp; I go to the little taverns where the sailors
lie all day long drinking black wine and playing with dice and I
sit down with them.</p>
<p>I made the Prince my slave, and his slave who was a Tyrian I
made my lord for the space of a moon.</p>
<p>I put a figured ring on his finger and brought him to my
house.&nbsp; I have wonderful things in my house.</p>
<p>The dust of the desert lies on your hair and your feet are
scratched with thorns and your body is scorched by the sun.&nbsp;
Come with me, Honorius, and I will clothe you in a tunic of
silk.&nbsp; I will smear your body with myrrh and pour spikenard
on your hair.&nbsp; I will clothe you in hyacinth and put honey
in your mouth.&nbsp; Love&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Honorius</span>.&nbsp; There is no love
but the love of God.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Myrrhina</span>.&nbsp; Who is He whose
love is greater than that of mortal men?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Honorius</span>.&nbsp; It is He whom thou
seest on the cross, Myrrhina.&nbsp; He is the Son of God and was
born of a virgin.&nbsp; Three wise men who were kings brought Him
offerings, and the shepherds who were lying on the hills were
wakened by a great light.</p>
<p>The Sibyls knew of His coming.&nbsp; The groves and the
oracles spake of Him.&nbsp; David and the prophets announced
Him.&nbsp; There is no love like the love of God nor any love
that can be compared to it.</p>
<p>The body is vile, Myrrhina.&nbsp; God will raise thee up with
a new body which will not know corruption, and thou shalt dwell
in the Courts of the Lord and see Him whose hair is like fine
wool and whose feet are of brass.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Myrrhina</span>.&nbsp; The beauty . .
.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Honorius</span>.&nbsp; The beauty of the
soul increases until it can see God.&nbsp; Therefore, Myrrhina,
repent of thy sins.&nbsp; The robber who was crucified beside Him
He brought into Paradise.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">[<i>Exit</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Myrrhina</span>.&nbsp; How strangely he
spake to me.&nbsp; And with what scorn did he regard me.&nbsp; I
wonder why he spake to me so strangely.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">. . . . .</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Honorius</span>.&nbsp; Myrrhina, the
scales have fallen from my eyes and I see now clearly what I did
not see before.&nbsp; Take me to Alexandria and let me taste of
the seven sins.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Myrrhina</span>.&nbsp; Do not mock me,
Honorius, nor speak to me with such bitter words.&nbsp; For I
have repented of my sins and I am seeking a cavern in this desert
where I too may dwell so that my soul may become worthy to see
God.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Honorius</span>.&nbsp; The sun is setting,
Myrrhina.&nbsp; Come with me to Alexandria.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Myrrhina</span>.&nbsp; I will not go to
Alexandria.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Honorius</span>.&nbsp; Farewell,
Myrrhina.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Myrrhina</span>.&nbsp; Honorius,
farewell.&nbsp; No, no, do not go.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">. . . . .</p>
<p>I have cursed my beauty for what it has done, and cursed the
wonder of my body for the evil that it has brought upon you.</p>
<p>Lord, this man brought me to Thy feet.&nbsp; He told me of Thy
coming upon earth, and of the wonder of Thy birth, and the great
wonder of Thy death also.&nbsp; By him, O Lord, Thou wast
revealed to me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Honorius</span>.&nbsp; You talk as a
child, Myrrhina, and without knowledge.&nbsp; Loosen your
hands.&nbsp; Why didst thou come to this valley in thy
beauty?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Myrrhina</span>.&nbsp; The God whom thou
worshippest led me here that I might repent of my iniquities and
know Him as the Lord.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Honorius</span>.&nbsp; Why didst thou
tempt me with words?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Myrrhina</span>.&nbsp; That thou shouldst
see Sin in its painted mask and look on Death in its robe of
Shame.</p>

<p>MARIA, a tire-woman.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>The action takes place at

<h3>A FLORENTINE TRAGEDY</h3>
<p>[<i>The scene represents a tapestried upper room giving on to
a balcony or loggia in an old house at Florence</i>.&nbsp; <i>A
table laid for a frugal meal</i>, <i>a spinning-wheel</i>,
<i>distaff</i>, <i>etc.</i>, <i>chests</i>, <i>chairs and
stools</i>.]</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>As the Curtain rises enter</i>
<span class="smcap">Bianca</span>, <i>with her Servant</i>, <span
class="smcap">Maria</span>.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Maria</span>.&nbsp; Certain
and sure, the sprig is Guido Bardi,<br />
A lovely lord, a lord whose blood is blue!</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Bianca</span>.&nbsp; But
where did he receive you?</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Maria</span>.&nbsp; Where,
but there<br />
In yonder palace, in a painted hall!&mdash;<br />
Painted with naked women on the walls,&mdash;<br />
Would make a common man or blush or smile<br />
But he seemed not to heed them, being a lord.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Bianca</span>.&nbsp; But
how know you &rsquo;tis not a chamberlayne,<br />
A lackey merely?</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Maria</span>.&nbsp; Why,
how know I there is a God in heaven?<br />
Because the angels have a master surely.<br />
So to this lord they bowed, all others bowed,<br />
And swept the marble flags, doffing their caps,<br />
With the gay plumes.&nbsp; Because he stiffly said,<br />
And seemed to see me as those folk are seen<br />
That will be never seen again by you,<br />
&lsquo;Woman, your mistress then returns this purse<br />
Of forty thousand crowns, is it fifty thousand?<br />
Come name the sum will buy me grace of her.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Bianca</span>.&nbsp; What,
were there forty thousand crowns therein?</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Maria</span>.&nbsp; I know
it was all gold; heavy with gold.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Bianca</span>.&nbsp; It
must be he, none else could give so much.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Maria</span>.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis he, &rsquo;tis my lord Guido, Guido Bardi.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Bianca</span>.&nbsp; What
said you?</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Maria</span>.&nbsp; I, I
said my mistress never<br />
Looked at the gold, never opened the purse,<br />
Never counted a coin.&nbsp; But asked again<br />
What she had asked before, &lsquo;How young you looked?<br />
How handsome your lordship looked?&nbsp; What doublet<br />
Your majesty had on?&nbsp; What chains, what hose<br />
Upon your revered legs?&rsquo;&nbsp; And curtseyed<br />
I, . . .</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Bianca</span>.&nbsp; What
said he?</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Maria</span>.&nbsp;
Curtseyed I, and he replied,<br />
&lsquo;Has she a lover then beside that old<br />
Soured husband or is it him she loves, my God!<br />
Is it him?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Bianca</span>.&nbsp;
Well?</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Maria</span>.&nbsp;
Curtseyed I low and said<br />
&lsquo;Not him, my lord, nor you, nor no man else.<br />
Thou art rich, my lord, and honoured, my lord, and she<br />
Though not so rich is honoured . . .&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Bianca</span>.&nbsp; Fool,
you fool,<br />
I never bid you say a word of that.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Maria</span>.&nbsp; Nor did
I say a word of that you said;<br />
I said, &lsquo;She loves him not, my lord, nor loves<br />
Any man else.&nbsp; Yet she might like to love,<br />
If she were loved by one who pleased her well;<br />
For she is weary of spinning long alone.<br />
She is not rich and yet she is not poor; but young<br />
She is, my lord, and you are young.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">[<i>Pauses smiling</i>.]</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Bianca</span>.&nbsp; Quick,
quick!</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Maria</span>.&nbsp; There,
there!&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas but to show you how I smiled<br />
Saying the lord was young.&nbsp; It took him too;<br />
For he said, &lsquo;This will do!&nbsp; If I should call<br />
To-night to pay respect unto your lovely&mdash;<br />
Our lovely mistress, tell her that I said,<br />
Our lovely mistress, shall I be received?&rsquo;<br />
And I said, &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Then say I come and
if<br />
All else is well let her throw down some favour<br />
When as I pass below.&rsquo;&nbsp; He should be there!<br />
Look from the balcony; he should be there!&mdash;<br />
And there he is, dost see?</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Bianca</span>.&nbsp; Some
favour.&nbsp; Yes.<br />
This ribbon weighted by this brooch will do.<br />
Maria, be you busy near within, but, till<br />
I call take care you enter not.&nbsp; Go down<br />
And let the young lord in, for hark, he knocks.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">[<i>Exit</i> <span
class="smcap">Maria</span>.]</p>
<p class="poetry">Great ladies might he choose from and yet he<br
/>
Is drawn . . . ah, there my fear is!&nbsp; Was he drawn<br />
By love to me&mdash;by love&rsquo;s young strength alone?<br />
That&rsquo;s where it is, if I were sure he loved,<br />
I then might do what greater dames have done<br />
And venge me on a husband blind to beauty.<br />
But if!&nbsp; Ah if! he is a wandering bee,<br />
Mere gallant taster, who befools poor flowers . . .</p>
<p style="text-align: center" class="poetry">[<span

<p class="poetry">My lord, I learn that we have something
here,<br />
In this poor house, which thou dost wish to buy.<br />
My husband is from home, but my poor fate<br />
Has made me perfect in the price of velvets,<br />
Of silks and gay brocades.&nbsp; I think you offered<br />
Some forty thousand crowns, or fifty thousand,<br />
For something we have here?&nbsp; And it must be<br />
That wonder of the loom, which my Simone<br />
Has lately home; it is a Lucca damask,<br />
The web is silver over-wrought with roses.<br />
Since you did offer fifty thousand crowns<br />
It must be that.&nbsp; Pray wait, for I will fetch it.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Guido</span>.&nbsp; Nay,
nay, thou gracious wonder of a loom<br />
More cunning far than those of Lucca, I<br />
Had in my thought no damask silver cloth<br />
By hunch-back weavers woven toilsomely,<br />
If such are priced at fifty thousand crowns<br />
It shames me, for I hoped to buy a fabric<br />
For which a hundred thousand then were little.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Bianca</span>.&nbsp; A
hundred thousand was it that you said?<br />
Nay, poor Simone for so great a sum<br />
Would sell you everything the house contains.<br />
The thought of such a sum doth daze the brains<br />
Of merchant folk who live such lives as ours.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Guido</span>.&nbsp; Would
he sell everything this house contains?<br />
And every one, would he sell every one?</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Bianca</span>.&nbsp; Oh,
everything and every one, my lord,<br />
Unless it were himself; he values not<br />
A woman as a velvet, or a wife<br />
At half the price of silver-threaded woof.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Guido</span>.&nbsp; Then I
would strike a bargain with him straight,</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Bianca</span>.&nbsp; He is
from home; may be will sleep from home;<br />
But I, my lord, can show you all we have;<br />
Can measure ells and sum their price, my lord.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Guido</span>.&nbsp; It is
thyself, Bianca, I would buy.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Bianca</span>.&nbsp; O,
then, my lord, it must be with Simone<br />
You strike your bargain; for to sell myself<br />
Would be to do what I most truly loathe.<br />
Good-night, my lord; it is with deep regret<br />
I find myself unable to oblige<br />
Your lordship.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Guido</span>.&nbsp; Nay, I
pray thee let me stay<br />
And pardon me the sorry part I played,<br />
As though I were a chapman and intent<br />
To lower prices, cheapen honest wares.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Bianca</span>.&nbsp; My
lord, there is no reason you should stay.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Guido</span>.&nbsp; Thou
art my reason, peerless, perfect, thou,<br />
The reason I am here and my life&rsquo;s goal,<br />
For I was born to love the fairest things . . .</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Bianca</span>.&nbsp; To buy
the fairest things that can be bought.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Guido</span>.&nbsp; Cruel
Bianca!&nbsp; Cover me with scorn,<br />
I answer born to love thy priceless self,<br />
That never to a market could be brought,<br />
No more than winged souls that sail and soar<br />
Among the planets or about the moon.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Bianca</span>.&nbsp; It is
so much thy habit to buy love,<br />
Or that which is for sale and labelled love,<br />
Hardly couldst thou conceive a priceless love.<br />
But though my love has never been for sale<br />
I have been in a market bought and sold.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Guido</span>.&nbsp; This is
some riddle which thy sweet wit reads<br />
To baffle mine and mock me yet again.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Bianca</span>.&nbsp; My
marriage, sir, I speak of marriage now,<br />
That common market where my husband went<br />
And prides himself he made a bargain then.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Guido</span>.&nbsp; The
wretched chapman, how I hate his soul.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Bianca</span>.&nbsp; He was
a better bidder than thyself,<br />
And knew with whom to deal . . . he did not speak<br />
Of gold to me, but in my father&rsquo;s ear<br />
He made it clink: to me he spoke of love,<br />
Honest and free and open without price.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Guido</span>.&nbsp; O white
Bianca, lovely as the moon,<br />
The light of thy pure soul and shining wit<br />
Shows me my shame, and makes the thing I was<br />
Slink like a shadow from the thing I am.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Bianca</span>.&nbsp; Let
that which casts the shadow act, my lord,<br />
And waste no thought on what its shadow does<br />
Or has done.&nbsp; Are youth, and strength, and love<br />
Balked by mere shadows, so that they forget<br />
Themselves so far they cannot be recalled?</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Guido</span>.&nbsp;
Nobility is here, not in the court.<br />
There are the tinsel stars, here is the moon,<br />
Whose tranquil splendour makes a day of night.<br />
I have been starved by ladies, specks of light,<br />
And glory drowns me now I see the moon.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Bianca</span>.&nbsp; I have
refused round sums of solid gold<br />
And shall not be by tinsel phrases bought.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Guido</span>.&nbsp; Dispute
no more, witty, divine Bianca;<br />
Dispute no more.&nbsp; See I have brought my lute!<br />
Close lock the door.&nbsp; We will sup with the moon<br />
Like Persian princes, that, in Babylon<br />
Sup in the hanging gardens of the king.<br />
I know an air that can suspend the soul<br />
As high in heaven as those towered-gardens hang.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Bianca</span>.&nbsp; My
husband may return, we are not safe.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Guido</span>.&nbsp; Didst
thou not say that he would sleep from home?</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Bianca</span>.&nbsp; He was
not sure, he said it might be so.<br />
He was not sure&mdash;and he would send my aunt<br />
To sleep with me, if he did so decide,<br />
And she has not yet come.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Guido</span>
[<i>starting</i>] Hark, what&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p style="text-align: center">[<i>They listen</i>, <i>the sound
of</i> <span class="smcap">Maria&rsquo;s</span> <i>voice in anger

<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Bianca</span>.&nbsp; It is
Maria scolds some gossip crone.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Guido</span>.&nbsp; I
thought the other voice had been a man&rsquo;s.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Bianca</span>.&nbsp; All
still again, old crones are often gruff.<br />
You should be gone, my lord.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Guido</span>.&nbsp; O,
sweet Bianca!<br />
How can I leave thee now!&nbsp; Thy beauty made<br />
Two captives of my eyes, and they were mad<br />
To feast them on thy form, but now thy wit,<br />
The liberated perfume of a bud,<br />
Which while a bud seemed perfect, but now is<br />
That which can make its former self forgot:<br />
How can I leave the flower who loved the leaf?<br />
Till now I was the richest prince in Florence,<br />
I am a lover now would shun its throngs,<br />
And put away all state and seek retreat<br />
At Bellosguardo or Fiesole,<br />
Where roses in their fin&rsquo;st profusion hide<br />
Some marble villa whose cool walls have rung<br />
A laughing echo to Decameron,<br />
And where thy laughter shall as gaily sound.<br />
Say thou canst love or with a silent kiss<br />
Instil that balmy knowledge on my soul.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Bianca</span>.&nbsp; Canst
tell me what love is?</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Guido</span>.&nbsp; It is
consent,<br />
The union of two minds, two souls, two hearts,<br />
In all they think and hope and feel.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Bianca</span>.&nbsp; Such
lovers might as well be dumb, for those<br />
Who think and hope and feel alike can never<br />
Have anything for one another&rsquo;s ear.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Guido</span>.&nbsp; Love
is?&nbsp; Love is the meeting of two worlds<br />
In never-ending change and counter-change.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Bianca</span>.&nbsp; Thus
will my husband praise the mercer&rsquo;s mart,<br />
Where the two worlds of East and West exchange.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Guido</span>.&nbsp;
Come.&nbsp; Love is love, a kiss, a close embrace.<br />
It is . . .</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Bianca</span>.&nbsp; My
husband calls that love<br />
When he hath slammed his weekly ledger to.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Guido</span>.&nbsp; I find
my wit no better match for thine<br />
Than thou art match for an old crabbed man;<br />
But I am sure my youth and strength and blood<br />
Keep better tune with beauty gay and bright<br />
As thine is, than lean age and miser toil.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Bianca</span>.&nbsp; Well
said, well said, I think he would not dare<br />
To face thee, more than owls dare face the sun;<br />
He&rsquo;s the bent shadow such a form as thine<br />
Might cast upon a dung heap by the road,<br />
Though should it fall upon a proper floor<br />
Twould be at once a better man than he.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Guido</span>.&nbsp; Your
merchant living in the dread of loss<br />
Becomes perforce a coward, eats his heart.<br />
Dull souls they are, who, like caged prisoners watch<br />
And envy others&rsquo; joy; they taste no food<br />
But what its cost is present to their thought.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Bianca</span>.&nbsp; I am
my father&rsquo;s daughter, in his eyes<br />
A home-bred girl who has been taught to spin.<br />
He never seems to think I have a face<br />
Which makes you gallants turn where&rsquo;er I pass.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Guido</span>.&nbsp; Thy
night is darker than I dreamed, bright Star.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Bianca</span>.&nbsp; He
waits, stands by, and mutters to himself,<br />
And never enters with a frank address<br />
To any company.&nbsp; His eyes meet mine<br />
And with a shudder I am sure he counts<br />
The cost of what I wear.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Guido</span>.&nbsp; Forget
him quite.<br />
Come, come, escape from out this dismal life,<br />
As a bright butterfly breaks spider&rsquo;s web,<br />
And nest with me among those rosy bowers,<br />
Where we will love, as though the lives we led<br />
Till yesterday were ghoulish dreams dispersed<br />
By the great dawn of limpid joyous life.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Bianca</span>.&nbsp; Will I
not come?</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Guido</span>.&nbsp; O, make
no question, come.<br />
They waste their time who ponder o&rsquo;er bad dreams.<br />
We will away to hills, red roses clothe,<br />
And though the persons who did haunt that dream<br />
Live on, they shall by distance dwindled, seem<br />
No bigger than the smallest ear of corn<br />
That cowers at the passing of a bird,<br />
And silent shall they seem, out of ear-shot,<br />
Those voices that could jar, while we gaze back<br />
From rosy caves upon the hill-brow open,<br />
And ask ourselves if what we see is not<br />
A picture merely,&mdash;if dusty, dingy lives<br />
Continue there to choke themselves with malice.<br />
Wilt thou not come, Bianca?&nbsp; Wilt thou not?</p>
<p style="text-align: right">[<i>A sound on the stair</i>.]</p>

<p style="text-align: center">[<i>The door opens</i>, <i>they

<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Simone</span>.&nbsp; My
good wife, you come slowly; were it not better<br />
To run to meet your lord?&nbsp; Here, take my cloak.<br />
Take this pack first.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis heavy.&nbsp; I have sold
nothing:<br />
Save a furred robe unto the Cardinal&rsquo;s son,<br />
Who hopes to wear it when his father dies,<br />
And hopes that will be soon.</p>
<p class="poetry">But who is this?<br />
Why you have here some friend.&nbsp; Some kinsman doubtless,<br
/>
Newly returned from foreign lands and fallen<br />
Upon a house without a host to greet him?<br />
I crave your pardon, kinsman.&nbsp; For a house<br />
Lacking a host is but an empty thing<br />
And void of honour; a cup without its wine,<br />
A scabbard without steel to keep it straight,<br />
A flowerless garden widowed of the sun.<br />
Again I crave your pardon, my sweet cousin.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Bianca</span>.&nbsp; This
is no kinsman and no cousin neither.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Simone</span>.&nbsp; No
kinsman, and no cousin!&nbsp; You amaze me.<br />
Who is it then who with such courtly grace<br />
Deigns to accept our hospitalities?</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Guido</span>.&nbsp; My name
is Guido Bardi.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Simone</span>.&nbsp;
What!&nbsp; The son<br />
Of that great Lord of Florence whose dim towers<br />
Like shadows silvered by the wandering moon<br />
I see from out my casement every night!<br />
Sir Guido Bardi, you are welcome here,<br />
Twice welcome.&nbsp; For I trust my honest wife,<br />
Most honest if uncomely to the eye,<br />
Hath not with foolish chatterings wearied you,<br />
As is the wont of women.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Guido</span>.&nbsp; Your
gracious lady,<br />
Whose beauty is a lamp that pales the stars<br />
And robs Diana&rsquo;s quiver of her beams<br />
Has welcomed me with such sweet courtesies<br />
That if it be her pleasure, and your own,<br />
I will come often to your simple house.<br />
And when your business bids you walk abroad<br />
I will sit here and charm her loneliness<br />
Lest she might sorrow for you overmuch.<br />
What say you, good Simone?</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Simone</span>.&nbsp; My
noble Lord,<br />
You bring me such high honour that my tongue<br />
Like a slave&rsquo;s tongue is tied, and cannot say<br />
The word it would.&nbsp; Yet not to give you thanks<br />
Were to be too unmannerly.&nbsp; So, I thank you,<br />
From my heart&rsquo;s core.</p>
<p class="poetry">It is such things as these<br />
That knit a state together, when a Prince<br />
So nobly born and of such fair address,<br />
Forgetting unjust Fortune&rsquo;s differences,<br />
Comes to an honest burgher&rsquo;s honest home<br />
As a most honest friend.</p>
<p class="poetry">And yet, my Lord,<br />
I fear I am too bold.&nbsp; Some other night<br />
We trust that you will come here as a friend;<br />
To-night you come to buy my merchandise.<br />
Is it not so?&nbsp; Silks, velvets, what you will,<br />
I doubt not but I have some dainty wares<br />
Will woo your fancy.&nbsp; True, the hour is late,<br />
But we poor merchants toil both night and day<br />
To make our scanty gains.&nbsp; The tolls are high,<br />
And every city levies its own toll,<br />
And prentices are unskilful, and wives even<br />
Lack sense and cunning, though Bianca here<br />
Has brought me a rich customer to-night.<br />
Is it not so, Bianca?&nbsp; But I waste time.<br />
Where is my pack?&nbsp; Where is my pack, I say?<br />
Open it, my good wife.&nbsp; Unloose the cords.<br />
Kneel down upon the floor.&nbsp; You are better so.<br />
Nay not that one, the other.&nbsp; Despatch, despatch!<br />
Buyers will grow impatient oftentimes.<br />
We dare not keep them waiting.&nbsp; Ay! &rsquo;tis that,<br />
Give it to me; with care.&nbsp; It is most costly.<br />
Touch it with care.&nbsp; And now, my noble Lord&mdash;<br />
Nay, pardon, I have here a Lucca damask,<br />
The very web of silver and the roses<br />
So cunningly wrought that they lack perfume merely<br />
To cheat the wanton sense.&nbsp; Touch it, my Lord.<br />
Is it not soft as water, strong as steel?<br />
And then the roses!&nbsp; Are they not finely woven?<br />
I think the hillsides that best love the rose,<br />
At Bellosguardo or at Fiesole,<br />
Throw no such blossoms on the lap of spring,<br />
Or if they do their blossoms droop and die.<br />
Such is the fate of all the dainty things<br />
That dance in wind and water.&nbsp; Nature herself<br />
Makes war on her own loveliness and slays<br />
Her children like Medea.&nbsp; Nay but, my Lord,<br />
Look closer still.&nbsp; Why in this damask here<br />
It is summer always, and no winter&rsquo;s tooth<br />
Will ever blight these blossoms.&nbsp; For every ell<br />
I paid a piece of gold.&nbsp; Red gold, and good,<br />
The fruit of careful thrift.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Guido</span>.&nbsp; Honest
Simone,<br />
Enough, I pray you.&nbsp; I am well content;<br />
To-morrow I will send my servant to you,<br />
Who will pay twice your price.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Simone</span>.&nbsp; My
generous Prince!<br />
I kiss your hands.&nbsp; And now I do remember<br />
Another treasure hidden in my house<br />
Which you must see.&nbsp; It is a robe of state:<br />
Woven by a Venetian: the stuff, cut-velvet:<br />
The pattern, pomegranates: each separate seed<br />
Wrought of a pearl: the collar all of pearls,<br />
As thick as moths in summer streets at night,<br />
And whiter than the moons that madmen see<br />
Through prison bars at morning.&nbsp; A male ruby<br />
Burns like a lighted coal within the clasp<br />
The Holy Father has not such a stone,<br />
Nor could the Indies show a brother to it.<br />
The brooch itself is of most curious art,<br />
Cellini never made a fairer thing<br />
To please the great Lorenzo.&nbsp; You must wear it.<br />
There is none worthier in our city here,<br />
And it will suit you well.&nbsp; Upon one side<br />
A slim and horned satyr leaps in gold<br />
To catch some nymph of silver.&nbsp; Upon the other<br />
Stands Silence with a crystal in her hand,<br />
No bigger than the smallest ear of corn,<br />
That wavers at the passing of a bird,<br />
And yet so cunningly wrought that one would say,<br />
It breathed, or held its breath.</p>
<p class="poetry">Worthy Bianca,<br />
Would not this noble and most costly robe<br />
Suit young Lord Guido well?</p>
<p class="poetry">Nay, but entreat him;<br />
He will refuse you nothing, though the price<br />
Be as a prince&rsquo;s ransom.&nbsp; And your profit<br />
Shall not be less than mine.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Bianca</span>.&nbsp; Am I
your prentice?<br />
Why should I chaffer for your velvet robe?</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Guido</span>.&nbsp; Nay,
fair Bianca, I will buy the robe,<br />
And all things that the honest merchant has<br />
I will buy also.&nbsp; Princes must be ransomed,<br />
And fortunate are all high lords who fall<br />
Into the white hands of so fair a foe.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Simone</span>.&nbsp; I
stand rebuked.&nbsp; But you will buy my wares?<br />
Will you not buy them?&nbsp; Fifty thousand crowns<br />
Would scarce repay me.&nbsp; But you, my Lord, shall have them<br
/>
For forty thousand.&nbsp; Is that price too high?<br />
Name your own price.&nbsp; I have a curious fancy<br />
To see you in this wonder of the loom<br />
Amidst the noble ladies of the court,<br />
A flower among flowers.</p>
<p class="poetry">They say, my lord,<br />
These highborn dames do so affect your Grace<br />
That where you go they throng like flies around you,<br />
Each seeking for your favour.</p>
<p class="poetry">I have heard also<br />
Of husbands that wear horns, and wear them bravely,<br />
A fashion most fantastical.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Guido</span>.&nbsp;
Simone,<br />
Your reckless tongue needs curbing; and besides,<br />
You do forget this gracious lady here<br />
Whose delicate ears are surely not attuned<br />
To such coarse music.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Simone</span>.&nbsp; True:
I had forgotten,<br />
Nor will offend again.&nbsp; Yet, my sweet Lord,<br />
You&rsquo;ll buy the robe of state.&nbsp; Will you not buy it?<br
/>
But forty thousand crowns&mdash;&rsquo;tis but a trifle,<br />
To one who is Giovanni Bardi&rsquo;s heir.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Guido</span>.&nbsp; Settle
this thing to-morrow with my steward,<br />
Antonio Costa.&nbsp; He will come to you.<br />
And you shall have a hundred thousand crowns<br />
If that will serve your purpose.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Simone</span>.&nbsp; A
hundred thousand!<br />
Said you a hundred thousand?&nbsp; Oh! be sure<br />
That will for all time and in everything<br />
Make me your debtor.&nbsp; Ay! from this time forth<br />
My house, with everything my house contains<br />
Is yours, and only yours.</p>
<p class="poetry">A hundred thousand!<br />
My brain is dazed.&nbsp; I shall be richer far<br />
Than all the other merchants.&nbsp; I will buy<br />
Vineyards and lands and gardens.&nbsp; Every loom<br />
From Milan down to Sicily shall be mine,<br />
And mine the pearls that the Arabian seas<br />
Store in their silent caverns.</p>
<p class="poetry">Generous Prince,<br />
This night shall prove the herald of my love,<br />
Which is so great that whatsoe&rsquo;er you ask<br />
It will not be denied you.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Guido</span>.&nbsp; What if
I asked<br />
For white Bianca here?</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Simone</span>.&nbsp; You
jest, my Lord;<br />
She is not worthy of so great a Prince.<br />
She is but made to keep the house and spin.<br />
Is it not so, good wife?&nbsp; It is so.&nbsp; Look!<br />
Your distaff waits for you.&nbsp; Sit down and spin.<br />
Women should not be idle in their homes,<br />
For idle fingers make a thoughtless heart.<br />
Sit down, I say.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Bianca</span>.&nbsp; What
shall I spin?</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Simone</span>.&nbsp; Oh!
spin<br />
Some robe which, dyed in purple, sorrow might wear<br />
For her own comforting: or some long-fringed cloth<br />
In which a new-born and unwelcome babe<br />
Might wail unheeded; or a dainty sheet<br />
Which, delicately perfumed with sweet herbs,<br />
Might serve to wrap a dead man.&nbsp; Spin what you will;<br />
I care not, I.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Bianca</span>.&nbsp; The
brittle thread is broken,<br />
The dull wheel wearies of its ceaseless round,<br />
The duller distaff sickens of its load;<br />
I will not spin to-night.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Simone</span>.&nbsp; It
matters not.<br />
To-morrow you shall spin, and every day<br />
Shall find you at your distaff.&nbsp; So Lucretia<br />
Was found by Tarquin.&nbsp; So, perchance, Lucretia<br />
Waited for Tarquin.&nbsp; Who knows?&nbsp; I have heard<br />
Strange things about men&rsquo;s wives.&nbsp; And now, my
lord,<br />
What news abroad?&nbsp; I heard to-day at Pisa<br />
That certain of the English merchants there<br />
Would sell their woollens at a lower rate<br />
Than the just laws allow, and have entreated<br />
The Signory to hear them.</p>
<p class="poetry">Is this well?<br />
Should merchant be to merchant as a wolf?<br />
And should the stranger living in our land<br />
Seek by enforced privilege or craft<br />
To rob us of our profits?</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Guido</span>.&nbsp; What
should I do<br />
With merchants or their profits?&nbsp; Shall I go<br />
And wrangle with the Signory on your count?<br />
And wear the gown in which you buy from fools,<br />
Or sell to sillier bidders?&nbsp; Honest Simone,<br />
Wool-selling or wool-gathering is for you.<br />
My wits have other quarries.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Bianca</span>.&nbsp; Noble
Lord,<br />
I pray you pardon my good husband here,<br />
His soul stands ever in the market-place,<br />
And his heart beats but at the price of wool.<br />
Yet he is honest in his common way.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">[<i>To</i> <span

<p class="poetry">And you, have you no shame?&nbsp; A gracious
Prince<br />
Comes to our house, and you must weary him<br />
With most misplaced assurance.&nbsp; Ask his pardon.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Simone</span>.&nbsp; I ask
it humbly.&nbsp; We will talk to-night<br />
Of other things.&nbsp; I hear the Holy Father<br />
Has sent a letter to the King of France<br />
Bidding him cross that shield of snow, the Alps,<br />
And make a peace in Italy, which will be<br />
Worse than a war of brothers, and more bloody<br />
Than civil rapine or intestine feuds.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Guido</span>.&nbsp; Oh! we
are weary of that King of France,<br />
Who never comes, but ever talks of coming.<br />
What are these things to me?&nbsp; There are other things<br />
Closer, and of more import, good Simone.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Bianca</span> [<i>To

What is the King of France to us?&nbsp; As much<br />
As are your English merchants with their wool.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Simone</span>.&nbsp; Is it
so then?&nbsp; Is all this mighty world<br />
Narrowed into the confines of this room<br />

Like cloth in some unskilful dyer&rsquo;s vat,<br />
Shrivels into a handbreadth, and perchance<br />
That time is now!&nbsp; Well! let that time be now.<br />

To give it greeting?&nbsp; Let Death go to houses<br />
Where there are vile, adulterous things, chaste wives<br />
Who growing weary of their noble lords<br />
Draw back the curtains of their marriage beds,<br />

But come before the lark with its shrill song<br />
Has waked a world of dreamers.&nbsp; I will stand<br />
Upon the balcony.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Guido</span>.&nbsp; And by
a ladder<br />
Wrought out of scarlet silk and sewn with pearls<br />
Will come to meet me.&nbsp; White foot after foot,<br />
Like snow upon a rose-tree.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Bianca</span>.&nbsp; As you
will.<br />
You know that I am yours for love or Death.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Guido</span>.&nbsp; Simone,
I must go to mine own house.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Simone</span>.&nbsp; So
soon?&nbsp; Why should you?&nbsp; The great Duomo&rsquo;s bell<br
/>
Has not yet tolled its midnight, and the watchmen<br />
Who with their hollow horns mock the pale moon,<br />
Lie drowsy in their towers.&nbsp; Stay awhile.<br />
I fear we may not see you here again,<br />
And that fear saddens my too simple heart.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Guido</span>.&nbsp; Be not
afraid, Simone.&nbsp; I will stand<br />
Most constant in my friendship, But to-night<br />
I go to mine own home, and that at once.<br />
To-morrow, sweet Bianca.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Simone</span>.&nbsp; Well,
well, so be it.<br />
I would have wished for fuller converse with you,<br />
My new friend, my honourable guest,<br />
But that it seems may not be.</p>
<p class="poetry">And besides<br />
I do not doubt your father waits for you,<br />
Wearying for voice or footstep.&nbsp; You, I think,<br />
Are his one child?&nbsp; He has no other child.<br />
You are the gracious pillar of his house,<br />
The flower of a garden full of weeds.<br />
Your father&rsquo;s nephews do not love him well<br />
So run folks&rsquo; tongues in Florence.&nbsp; I meant but
that.<br />
Men say they envy your inheritance<br />
And look upon your vineyards with fierce eyes<br />
As Ahab looked on Naboth&rsquo;s goodly field.<br />
But that is but the chatter of a town<br />
Where women talk too much.</p>
<p class="poetry">Good-night, my lord.<br />
Fetch a pine torch, Bianca.&nbsp; The old staircase<br />
Is full of pitfalls, and the churlish moon<br />
Grows, like a miser, niggard of her beams,<br />
And hides her face behind a muslin mask<br />
As harlots do when they go forth to snare<br />
Some wretched soul in sin.&nbsp; Now, I will get<br />
Your cloak and sword.&nbsp; Nay, pardon, my good Lord,<br />
It is but meet that I should wait on you<br />
Who have so honoured my poor burgher&rsquo;s house,<br />
Drunk of my wine, and broken bread, and made<br />
Yourself a sweet familiar.&nbsp; Oftentimes<br />
My wife and I will talk of this fair night<br />
And its great issues.</p>
<p class="poetry">Why, what a sword is this.<br />
Ferrara&rsquo;s temper, pliant as a snake,<br />
And deadlier, I doubt not.&nbsp; With such steel,<br />
One need fear nothing in the moil of life.<br />
I never touched so delicate a blade.<br />
I have a sword too, somewhat rusted now.<br />
We men of peace are taught humility,<br />
And to bear many burdens on our backs,<br />
And not to murmur at an unjust world,<br />
And to endure unjust indignities.<br />
We are taught that, and like the patient Jew<br />
Find profit in our pain.</p>
<p class="poetry">Yet I remember<br />
How once upon the road to Padua<br />
A robber sought to take my pack-horse from me,<br />
I slit his throat and left him.&nbsp; I can bear<br />
Dishonour, public insult, many shames,<br />
Shrill scorn, and open contumely, but he<br />
Who filches from me something that is mine,<br />
Ay! though it be the meanest trencher-plate<br />
From which I feed mine appetite&mdash;oh! he<br />
Perils his soul and body in the theft<br />
And dies for his small sin.&nbsp; From what strange clay<br />
We men are moulded!</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Guido</span>.&nbsp; Why do
you speak like this?</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Simone</span>.&nbsp; I
wonder, my Lord Guido, if my sword<br />
Is better tempered than this steel of yours?<br />
Shall we make trial?&nbsp; Or is my state too low<br />
For you to cross your rapier against mine,<br />
In jest, or earnest?</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Guido</span>.&nbsp; Naught
would please me better<br />
Than to stand fronting you with naked blade<br />
In jest, or earnest.&nbsp; Give me mine own sword.<br />
Fetch yours.&nbsp; To-night will settle the great issue<br />
Whether the Prince&rsquo;s or the merchant&rsquo;s steel<br />
Is better tempered.&nbsp; Was not that your word?<br />
Fetch your own sword.&nbsp; Why do you tarry, sir?</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Simone</span>.&nbsp; My
lord, of all the gracious courtesies<br />
That you have showered on my barren house<br />
This is the highest.</p>
<p class="poetry">Bianca, fetch my sword.<br />
Thrust back that stool and table.&nbsp; We must have<br />
An open circle for our match at arms,<br />
And good Bianca here shall hold the torch<br />
Lest what is but a jest grow serious.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Bianca</span> [<i>To
Guido</i>].&nbsp; Oh! kill him, kill him!</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Simone</span>.&nbsp; Hold
the torch, Bianca.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">[<i>They begin to fight</i>.]</p>

at you!&nbsp; Ah!&nbsp; Ha! would you?</p>
<p style="text-align: right">[<i>He is wounded by</i> <span

<p class="poetry">A scratch, no more.&nbsp; The torch was in mine
eyes.<br />
Do not look sad, Bianca.&nbsp; It is nothing.<br />
Your husband bleeds, &rsquo;tis nothing.&nbsp; Take a cloth,<br
/>
Bind it about mine arm.&nbsp; Nay, not so tight.<br />
More softly, my good wife.&nbsp; And be not sad,<br />
I pray you be not sad.&nbsp; No; take it off.<br />
What matter if I bleed?</p>

I am my father&rsquo;s only son; the State<br />

To fall upon our city.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Simone</span>.&nbsp; Hush!

As for the State, I think our state of Florence<br />

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you

with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
